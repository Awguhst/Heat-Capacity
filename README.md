# Heat Capacity

Here, I am using the [**QM9-Extended dataset**](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Exploring_Deep_Learning_of_Quantum_Chemical_Properties_for_Absorption_Distribution_Metabolism_and_Excretion_Predictions/20160571?file=38616061), an improved version of the original `QM9 dataset`, to predict heat capacity, which is a pretty cool property or something like that idk. The dataset also includes other `descriptors` that can be predicted with similar accuracy.
